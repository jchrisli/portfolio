  My research mainly explores novel interface and artifact designs that use robots to unlock unique telepresence and communication in remote collaborative systems, especially for a group of users who can share and reconfigure the robots.

  I am also interested in the potential of virtual reality for people to relive and reinterpret other people's experiences, such as immersive tours, or art creation sessions.
